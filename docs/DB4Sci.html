DB4Sci is an easy to use web-based self service database deployment application. 
Users can select a database type and version and DB4Sci creates a stand alone database instance for the user.
Each deployed database instance is a separate container with its own unique data volumes.
Versions of PostgreSQL, MariaDB, Mongo and Neo4j can be selected. 
DB4Sci is a fully containerized Flask application.

<p>
Scientist should be doing science not IT. Create a new DB instance in seconds without submitting a help desk ticket. MyDB create screen is beautiful and much easier to use than a ticket system to request IT help. MyDB will take care of all the backups.

Why MyDB? Performs complex configuration of Containers. 
MyDB can deploy MariaDB with encryption at rest enabled and TLS configured.
Reply PostgreSQL with multi core parallelization enabled.
Neo4j is deployed in secure mode with https enabled and configured.
Reply MariaDB in secure mode.

Performance MyDB Postscript performance is better than AWS XX.  Its the fastest DB we have benched marked.  Why build something that is slow?  Hardware is cheap our local instance has a few hundred TB of Mvme SSD storage.

Support Multiple Storage Types:  Mount what ever storage you want to MyDB. From the create screen give users the choice to choose storage types. Access to storage types can me managed by DB type and user id. To support encryption at rest for Postgres we provision an Ext4 encrypted filesystem which is limited to PostgeSQL databases.
